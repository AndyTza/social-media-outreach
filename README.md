# Astronomy Outreach with Social Media `dotastronomy`, 2023

Hello,

In this repository you will find `Social Media 101 Resouces.pdf` a compiled list of mostly open-source tools to enable content creators to create amazing and accessible STEM content. 

I also hope to hack on this live document in the coming days (as part .astronomy 2023), so please come back if you'd like to see more exciting open-source resources. If you have any questions or recommendations please reach out.
